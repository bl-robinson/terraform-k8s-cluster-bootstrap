Repo to bootstrap initial things onto a fresh k8s cluster booted with https://github.com/bl-robinson/k8s-libvirt-cluster

I would have liked to do more of this in flux. But flux is dependent on the CNI from cilium being present, and as the ingress setup is all part of that. I just install it all together.
